      <description>In this post and the following one I&amp;rsquo;ll go over the most basic Cypress commands which are:
 selecting elements act on these elements  Selections are discussed in this post, I keep the action part for the next post.
Examples are based on the Cypress kitchen sink example site(often slightly modified to make the point more clear in context of this post). This example app covers all existing Cypress commands.</description>

      <description>Goal Unix philosophy In line with the Unix philosophy I wanted to build a small system which is as user-friendly as possible (even though I might be the only user). I chose a system which would help me with a personal goal namely learning Russian.
Learning Russian Recently I scraped example phrases for the most common Russian words. Based on Zipf&amp;rsquo;s law it makes sense to really focus on the most common words since the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table.</description>

      <description>Penitentials were handbooks carried by some priests in the Middle Ages that delineated various sins for private confession and their penances. They were full of strict limitations as to what constituted pious behavior. They went on and on. To digest it all, James A Brundage, a scholar of the Crusades, aggregated the complex rules about sex into this excellent flowchart.

      <description>The UK is the biggest tax haven.
For decades, places such as Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, Gibraltar and others sold the companies that people hide behind when committing their crimes. But in recent years, the world has changed – those jurisdictions have been cajoled, bullied and persuaded to keep good records of company ownership, and to reveal those records when police officers come looking. They are no longer as useful as they used to be.</description>

      <description>Goal of this post We compare the most common data manipulations between dplyr and awk in terms of functionality.
As explained perfectly in the tidyverse article there are 5 types of common data manipulations:
 filter select mutate summarise arrange  I go over each of these manipulations and show using examples in dplyr and awk how to implement them.
Some aspects of these data manipulations are not covered in this article:</description>

      <description>Debugging If you use R5RS as language, you can use the trace function to see the call stack.
E.g.
(#%require racket/trace) (define (sum-integers a b) (if (&amp;gt; a b) 0 (+ a (sum-integers (+ a 1) b)))) (trace sum-integers) (sum-integers 1 5)  Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to specify the require because [trace] is not included in R5D5 by default.</description>

      <description>Carrier bag theory.
Not only is the carrier bag theory plausible, it also does meaningful ideological work — shifting the way we look at humanity&amp;rsquo;s foundations from a narrative of domination to one of gathering, holding, and sharing. Because I am, despite my best efforts, often soppy and sentimental, I sometimes imagine this like a really comforting group hug. But it’s not, really: the carrier bag holds things, sure, but it’s also messy and sometimes conflicted</description>

      <description>Explanation in blog post easier than the one the book.
Evaluation:
 normal order  expand and reduce all functions first then evaluate parameters lazy  applicative order  evaluate and apply function first then formal parameters loop eager   So why does the test work? p will never stop executing when evaluating since there&amp;rsquo;s no stopping condition. So if we use the evaluate and apply model from applicative order evaluation the first thing that will be done is evaluating the p procedure thus hanging the process.</description>

      <description>Another chess analysis but this time I annotated a bit different than I did for the one of 24-09-2019:
 less focus on strategy only using local analysis tags  Blunders made are still quite big. These have to be purged first before making sound strategic decisions pay off.
By default Lichess annotates your game with automated comments like blunder, mistake,&amp;hellip; I found those quite annoying but since there&amp;rsquo;s no option to turn them off somehow forcing you to manually remove them one by one, for the time being I choose to only use local analysis.</description>

      <description>Yeah.
Being in New York compounded a feeling I had been experiencing, of profound dissociation from my own life. I knew, as I wandered through museums with friends and video-chatted with Ian, that I needed to leave the tech industry. I was no longer high on the energy of being around people who so easily satisfied their desires––on the feeling that everything was just within reach. The industry’s hubris and naïveté were beginning to grate; I had moral, political, and personal misgivings about Silicon Valley’s accelerating colonization of art, work, everyday life.</description>

      <description>The 11-23 most common verbs in Russian.
Some verbs are skipped because they form perfective/imperfective pairs. For example there&amp;rsquo;s делать/сделать but at the moment I only focus on remembering the easiest form (whether perfective or imperfective).
Main version:
   Russian English remark verb     На этой станции поезд стоит 10 минут. The train stops for ten minutes in this station. стан - ции стоять   Я думаю о тебе.</description>

      <description>Борис самый большой молодец всех времен.
+++++
Boris is the biggest little boy of all times.
