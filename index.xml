      <description>Was niet zo onder de indruk van Morphy tot ik beseft dat hij pas 11 was toen dit spel gespeeld werd. Geboren in 1837 en gespeeld in 1848.

 I was at home one afternoon when a man rang the intercom and asked whether I could buzz him into the building. He said that his turtle had fallen out the window and into the alley between his building and mine, and that he wanted to get to the alley from my building’s basement.</description>

      <description>Living with geese.
 I had an old, loud China gander that was displaced by a younger gander—his son, as a matter of fact, who ended up with the old goose we named Jocasta. From the time of Adam, we humans have had an urge to name the birds of the sky and the beasts of the field. The old gander may have been defeated by the son, but he remained feisty.</description>

      <description>Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance.
 It was all those people in the cars coming the other way, she says. The first one looked so sad. And then the next one looked exactly the same way, and then the next one and the next one, they were all the same.
They were just commuting to work.
 The word trespassing is closely connected technology.

How to analyze your chess game:
 As soon as possible after the game, write down the variations that you were thinking about during the game, especially the ones that were not played.
 How do you even develop an interest like that in Joan of Arc?

 Others feel time is standing still right now, but for me it is slipping through my fingers.
 Often with those things, you’re waiting for someone else to grant you some kind of permission to do it.
 You realise a lot of things; you dissect a lot of things when you spend an extended period by yourself.</description>

      <description>Debug your app, not your environment.
 Docker&amp;rsquo;s slogan is a good one. It&amp;rsquo;s a pity when you can&amp;rsquo;t focus on the work at hand because of environment issues. You end up trying to fix both your code and the environment at the same which frankly is just a world of pain. Docker helps with creating a reproducible environment so you can count on the environment being always in the state you want.</description>

      <description>By default the Mac installation of git uses vim as editor. If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with vim this can be quite hard. I&amp;rsquo;m used to Visual Code and it&amp;rsquo;s easy to configure Visual code as the default:
git config --global core.editor &amp;quot;code&amp;quot;  You can see for yourself the configuration has been updated. Either by running the git config command with the --list option:
git config --list | grep core.editor  Or by verifying the config file itself.</description>

git config --global user.name &amp;quot;a&amp;quot;; echo a &amp;gt;&amp;gt; whoami; git commit -m &amp;quot;whoami a&amp;quot; git push;  I can see my name has changed:</description>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s git bisect and why use it? While browsing the git documentation, I noticed there are some debugging git commands I never heard about before. git bisect in particular seemed interesting. With git bisect it&amp;rsquo;s easy to track down when and where a bug was introduced. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll cover the same use cases as in the git documentation but with another example. This way I can be sure I thoroughly understood how to use git bisect.</description>

 I recently uncovered a physical plaque that could potentially be about a billion years old and it already generates about one million hours of video content passively overnight. So you can trust that.

      <description>This post will cover the handling complexity part as outlined in the introduction post of this series. Originally I was aiming to use make, just as in the original series of posts which inspired mine. After some consideration I chose to opt for Airflow:
 it&amp;rsquo;s used heavily at work I have no experience at all using it (in contrast with make which I used in a basic way from time to time) it comes with out-of-the-box integrations leverages Python abilities  All of the above should make the learning curve of Airflow lower than the make learning curve.</description>

      <description>In the last post I went over the tools used for testing, continuous integration and cloud deployment together with a small explanation why exactly I chose those tools to use. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll go more into detail about Travis (which is one of the tools used next to Cypress and Heroku). The explanation won&amp;rsquo;t be exhaustive, but I&amp;rsquo;ll just note what struck me most while incorporating Travis in the easy newspapers project.</description>

I just focused on the raw scores without linking them to teams or anything and already several, more or less interesting, questions came up naturally.

      <description>First entry I ever noticed on RPubs. Holy duality of pie chart and calling every document final. Hope the author is ok.
“I could come up with something else of my own again, put it out on a label, tour, etc. It’s just gotta feel free if that happens. I will probably honestly be 40 or 50 when that happens and extremely fat.”
I work on R packages that alleviate some of the pain of transforming and presenting data in a dreary office environment.</description>

      <description>Made a post about possible rank changes for teams in the Jupiler Pro League. Felt inspired to try to replicate this post on r/dataisbeautiful. Integrating rmarkdown with Hugo didn&amp;rsquo;t seem straightforward so I decided to publish it to RPubs and link to it from here.
Code for this post can be found on GitHub . Used the package structure again as in the reproducible analysis series and found it very enjoyable.</description>

      <description>Issue When starting off as a beginner doing data analysis you often start with hacking together some scripts. You pick whatever you can find, throw it in the mix and let everything run. These scripts create output like plots, tables, &amp;hellip; which you manually copy afterwards into some document. There are several reasons why this is frankly an excruciating way of working:
 if some output changes you have to manually copy the changed results to the document where you write the analysis changing some parameters of your analysis requires rerunning everything the explanation of what your code does is totally decoupled from the code itself  All this doesn&amp;rsquo;t really favor reproducible analysis.</description>

      <description>Issue We wrote the code, we wrote the tests but we didn&amp;rsquo;t specify explicitly how the code can be used. Take for example the calculateAutoCorrelation function. From its name we can infer it should return some kind of auto correlation coefficient. But how exactly is this correlation calculated? What kind of lag we take into account? Those questions can more easily be answered if we add some metadata to the functions we created.</description>

      <description>Issue When writing code we have some expectations about what it should do. We&amp;rsquo;d like it do something and, even better, do exactly what we want. Verifying this is harder than it seems. You can load a function, run it with some data and check manually if you like the results. However, this scales pretty badly as your code base grows. It becomes impossible to manually check all the details and accidents are bound to happen.</description>

      <description>Problem Create a function counting how many valid smileys there are in an array.
Solution The solution seems to need these functions:
 a function to split a smiley in its characters some functions to check if eyes, mouth or nose are valid  Then loop over all smileys and split/check each of them.
 function countSmileys(arr) { splitSmiley = smiley = smiley.split(&#34;&#34;) checkEyes = splittedSmiley = { validEyes = [&#39;:&#39;,&#39;;&#39;] eye = splittedSmiley[0] return validEyes.</description>

      <description>Murderball was invented by the Quadfather.
The author’s explanation is that humans were essentially happy and satisfied with their lives. When they became civilized, the concept of progress led to misery.
    They came to do good, they did very well indeed.
To emphasize the work ethic in Protestantism relative to Catholics, he notes a common problem that industrialists face when employing precapitalist laborers: Agricultural entrepreneurs will try to encourage time spent harvesting by offering a higher wage, with the expectation that laborers will see time spent working as more valuable and so engage it longer.</description>

      <description>Old Believers, you have to update!
After the implementation of these revisions, the Church anathematized and suppressed—with the support of Muscovite state power—the prior liturgical rite itself, as well as those who were reluctant to pass to the revised rite.
That’s forcing people to upgrade, no depreciation warning.

      <description>Issue Packages are used to share your R code with others. Why then should this be the first topic tackled? Couldn&amp;rsquo;t we make our code shareable after we made something to actually share? Well, I actually don&amp;rsquo;t make the analysis a package mainly for sharing it (even though it&amp;rsquo;s nice to have). Packages also have the very nice side effect they enforce conventions. Other packages (e.g. testthat) build on these conventions.</description>

      <description>Stating the obvious here, but before we can start playing around with the code we need code to play around with. As said in last post each step in the data analysis cycle will have its own function as an example.
Concerns about how to structure this code are not relevant at the moment. First things first so we throw all the functions together in a file called analysis.R. This file is also used to &amp;ldquo;orchestrate&amp;rdquo; (between quotation marks since orchestration in this case is just running each function after another).</description>

      <description>Motivation Last analysis post I made I hit quite a few stumbling blocks making the analysis take longer than expected. When reflecting on why this was the case I realized I hadn&amp;rsquo;t taken reproducibility into account. I made the post in the span of a week and already I realized parts were not documented well enough, not tested well enough, code versions weren&amp;rsquo;t tracked as they should, &amp;hellip; All this can be put under the banner of reproducibility.</description>

      <description>Some interesting eavesdropping.
The moment those drums kick in&amp;hellip;
Just under a century ago, the Soviet Union embarked on one of the strangest attempts to reshape the common calendar that has ever been undertaken. As Joseph Stalin raced to turn an agricultural backwater into an industrialized nation, his government downsized the week from seven to five days. Saturday and Sunday were abolished.
In place of the weekend, a new system of respite was introduced in 1929.</description>

      <description>This decision was made to increase the amount of funding received from the European Union, which dedicates a third of its budget (50 billion euros) to less economically developed regions for investments in infrastructure, such as schools and hospitals. Yet when regions improve economically, they no longer qualify for the same amount of funding. As a type of statistical gerrymandering, governors of these regions—like in Hungary—have redrawn their borders in order to keep the money flowing.</description>

      <description>Goal Unix philosophy In line with the Unix philosophy I wanted to build a small system which is as user-friendly as possible (even though I might be the only user). I chose a system which would help me with a personal goal namely learning Russian.
Learning Russian Recently I scraped example phrases for the most common Russian words. Based on Zipf&amp;rsquo;s law it makes sense to really focus on the most common words since the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table.</description>

      <description>Penitentials were handbooks carried by some priests in the Middle Ages that delineated various sins for private confession and their penances. They were full of strict limitations as to what constituted pious behavior. They went on and on. To digest it all, James A Brundage, a scholar of the Crusades, aggregated the complex rules about sex into this excellent flowchart.

      <description>The UK is the biggest tax haven.
For decades, places such as Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, Gibraltar and others sold the companies that people hide behind when committing their crimes. But in recent years, the world has changed – those jurisdictions have been cajoled, bullied and persuaded to keep good records of company ownership, and to reveal those records when police officers come looking. They are no longer as useful as they used to be.</description>

As explained perfectly in the tidyverse article there are 5 types of common data manipulations:
 filter select mutate summarise arrange  I go over each of these manipulations and show using examples in dplyr and awk how to implement them.
Some aspects of these data manipulations are not covered in this article:</description>

      <description>Carrier bag theory.
Not only is the carrier bag theory plausible, it also does meaningful ideological work — shifting the way we look at humanity&amp;rsquo;s foundations from a narrative of domination to one of gathering, holding, and sharing. Because I am, despite my best efforts, often soppy and sentimental, I sometimes imagine this like a really comforting group hug. But it’s not, really: the carrier bag holds things, sure, but it’s also messy and sometimes conflicted</description>

      <description>Another chess analysis but this time I annotated a bit different than I did for the one of 24-09-2019:
 less focus on strategy only using local analysis tags  Blunders made are still quite big. These have to be purged first before making sound strategic decisions pay off.
By default Lichess annotates your game with automated comments like blunder, mistake,&amp;hellip; I found those quite annoying but since there&amp;rsquo;s no option to turn them off somehow forcing you to manually remove them one by one, for the time being I choose to only use local analysis.</description>

      <description>Yeah.
Being in New York compounded a feeling I had been experiencing, of profound dissociation from my own life. I knew, as I wandered through museums with friends and video-chatted with Ian, that I needed to leave the tech industry. I was no longer high on the energy of being around people who so easily satisfied their desires––on the feeling that everything was just within reach. The industry’s hubris and naïveté were beginning to grate; I had moral, political, and personal misgivings about Silicon Valley’s accelerating colonization of art, work, everyday life.</description>

Could be.
A disappearance begins internally, experienced en masse, but with each one—roses, photographs, and fruit follow—long-coated, stone-faced Memory Police sweep through the village, ensuring that all traces of the disappeared concept or object is gone for good. What exactly causes disappearances is never addressed; instead, the mystery lies in how far they&amp;rsquo;ll go, and what role the Memory Police play.</description>

      <description>Борис самый большой молодец всех времен.
+++++
Boris is the biggest little boy of all times.
+++++
самый большой = most big = biggest
молодец &amp;lt; молодой which means young. ец is a suffix appended to adjectives to create a masculine noun denoting a person having the adjective&amp;rsquo;s quality. So in this case a man who is young is a boy. The more conventional word for boy is мальчик which is interesting as well because it&amp;rsquo;s a combination of малый +‎ -чик.</description>
