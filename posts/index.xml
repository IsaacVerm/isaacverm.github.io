      <description>Rationale Everyone comes in touch with the web every day. Opening a browser is as natural as waking up. Sadly enough, way less people know how the web really works. That&amp;rsquo;s a pity because once you know how it work possibilities are endless. You can start manipulating the web any way you want which is close to being a magician!
In this tutorial I&amp;rsquo;d like to show:
 web development isn&amp;rsquo;t hard to learn and learning it is fun while learning you are already creating something and creating is fun so you have already double fun and then you can share it sharing is also fun  So as you can see you&amp;rsquo;re set up for triple whammy of pleasure with this article.</description>
