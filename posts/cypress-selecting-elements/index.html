<p>In this post and the following one I&rsquo;ll go over the most basic Cypress commands which are:</p>

<ul>
<li>selecting elements</li>
<li>act on these elements</li>
</ul>

<p>Selections are discussed in this post, I keep the action part for the next post.</p>

<p>Examples are based on the <a href="https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-kitchensink">Cypress kitchen sink example</a> site(often slightly modified to make the point more clear in context of this post). This example app covers all existing Cypress commands.</p>

<p>Why start a series of testing articles with an article about an E2E testing framework? Isn&rsquo;t that completely against <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html#TheImportanceOftestAutomation">the logic of the test pyramid</a> where you&rsquo;d try to have as many unit tests as possible and try to limit the number of E2E tests? As stated by Martin Fowler:</p>

<p><em>Write lots of small and fast unit tests. Write some more coarse-grained tests and very few high-level tests that test your application from end to end.</em></p>

<p>However, that&rsquo;s only one point of view. Another strategy could be to do the <a href="https://www.cypress.io/blog/2019/10/10/guest-post-new-to-front-end-testing-start-from-the-top-of-the-pyramid/">exact opposite</a>. Advantages of this strategy are:</p>

<ul>
<li>you use a browser just like a user would</li>
<li>your tests go through your app exactly as how a user would go through it</li>
<li>it&rsquo;s easy cover a large part of the app with a limited number of tests</li>
</ul>

<p>This post states nothing shocking but:</p>

<ul>
<li>it gave me a chance to go a bit more in depth as to how the Cypress basics work</li>
<li>it&rsquo;s kind of a memory aid to myself</li>
<li>links the Cypress documentation with some Devtools and CSS selection basics</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="querying">Querying</h2>

<p>Querying in Cypress is either done based on:</p>

<ul>
<li>a css selector using <code>cy.get()</code></li>
<li>text using <code>cy.contains()</code></li>
</ul>

<p>99% of the times you will limit yourself to css selectors. Text can change making tests brittle. The <code>cy.get()</code> command may seem very clear on the outside but has a lot of interesting features.</p>

<h3 id="waiting">Waiting</h3>

<p>One of the core features of Cypress is it waits for &ldquo;key moments&rdquo; of your application state to be reached. As long as these key moments have not been reached Cypress will <a href="https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/key-differences.html#Flake-resistant">keep waiting</a>. There no need for explicit waits which would make your tests flaky. How would you determine the correct waiting time anyway? Maybe the tests are ran on a slow machine, a slow network, &hellip;</p>

<p>You can see how important this is by yourself. By default the timeout <code>cy.get()</code> uses is 4 seconds. If trying to run our tests without doing a <code>cy.visit()</code> first (so nothing is loaded) you&rsquo;ll notice the test won&rsquo;t fail immediately. It will keep on trying during the timeout period.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="color:#75715e">// cy.visit(&#39;http://localhost:8080/commands/querying&#39;)
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span><span style="color:#a6e22e">cy</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">get</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;#query-btn&#39;</span>).<span style="color:#a6e22e">should</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;contain&#39;</span>, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;Button&#39;</span>)
</code></pre></div>

<p><img src="/cypress-4s-get-timeout.png" alt="4s timeout" /></p>

<p>And we can override the timeout to see the effect:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span style="color:#75715e">// cy.visit(&#39;http://localhost:8080/commands/querying&#39;)
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span><span style="color:#a6e22e">cy</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">get</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;#query-btn&#39;</span>, {<span style="color:#a6e22e">timeout</span><span style="color:#f92672">:</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">10000</span>}).<span style="color:#a6e22e">should</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;contain&#39;</span>, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;Button&#39;</span>)
</code></pre></div>

<p><img src="/cypress-10s-get-timeout.png" alt="4s timeout" /></p>

<p>Note as well the timeout we get isn&rsquo;t exactly 4 or 10 seconds but just a bit tiny bit more. This drives home another point: Cypress runs commands <strong>inside</strong> the browser meaning there&rsquo;s <a href="https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/key-differences.html#Flake-resistant">almost no lag</a>.</p>

<p>Small note, <code>cy.get()</code> only checks the existence of a DOM element. This does not mean the element is rendered as you&rsquo;d expect it to with all CSS applied.</p>

<h3 id="devtools">DevTools</h3>

<p>Another interesting aspect of <code>get()</code> is it yields a jQuery object. A jQuery object is an <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6445180/what-is-a-jquery-object">array-like</a> object but not exactly an array. Methods which work fine on arrays won&rsquo;t work for these jQuery objects. The jQuery object contains a lot of useful information you can use to write better tests. You can see for yourself if you open the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console/utilities">Chrome DevTools</a> and go to the Console tab. If you click on any <code>cy.get()</code> command, a small summary of the contents of the jQuery object will be printed to the console. We want to further investigate this element so let&rsquo;s give it a name:</p>

<p><img src="/create-test-button-console.png" alt="Test button" /></p>

<p>A reference of the syntax used in the DevTools console can be found <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console/utilities">here</a>. Pay attention, this is no <a href="https://api.jquery.com">jQuery syntax</a> so you can only run these DevTools command in DevTools itself.</p>

<p>Since we now have a reference to our jQuery object we can start playing around with it. Most interesting are its attributes and the css applied. Getting these values is quite simple:</p>

<p><img src="/get-attr-and-css-console.png" alt="Test button" /></p>

<p>However, you can go further and modify these values yourself. This way you can do some manual exploratory testing within automated tests. It&rsquo;s like having a REPL with your whole browser evaluating. As an example let&rsquo;s say we want to be sure if the href value of a hyperlink element is changed you&rsquo;re directed to another url (bit contrived but that&rsquo;s besides the point).</p>

<p><img src="/set-attr-console.png" alt="Test button" /></p>

<h2 id="traversal">Traversal</h2>

<p>In essence just knowing the <code>cy.get()</code> command is enough to cater to all your selection needs. However, Cypress provides certain helper traversal commands to make it easier to select elements. I&rsquo;ll go over the main traversal commands leaving some which are rarely used aside. If an appropriate css selector <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_combinators.asp">combinator</a> exists it&rsquo;s mentioned as well.</p>

<h3 id="children">children()</h3>

<p>Does exactly as it says, gives the children of the selected element.</p>

<p>Its CSS selection equivalent is <code>&gt;</code> so those are the same:</p>

<p><img src="/traversal-children.png" alt="Traversal children" /></p>

<p>Interestingly enough, you can filter the children selected if you pass a selector to <code>children()</code> (for example if you want to select only active children elements).</p>

<h3 id="closest">closest()</h3>

<p>This command traverses up the DOM tree. It stops looking further the moment it finds its match (hence closest).</p>

<p><img src="/closest-html-example.png" alt="Closest HTML example" /></p>

<p>Going up from the span element there are 2 div elements. Since we use <code>closest()</code> we expect it to match with the div with class well and not the one with class col-xs-5.</p>

<p><img src="/traversal-closest.png" alt="Traversal closest" /></p>

<p>This command has no CSS selection equivalent.</p>

<h3 id="eq">eq()</h3>

<p>This command get an element at an index. Its CSS selection equivalent is <code>nth-child()</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/traversal-eq.png" alt="Traversal eq" /></p>

<p>Pay attention: the counting in Cypress and in the CSS selection differs by 1. <code>nth-child()</code> starts at 1, <code>eq() starts at 0</code>.</p>

<h3 id="find">find()</h3>

<p>This command get the descendants of a selector. The name is somewhat confusing since it doesn&rsquo;t refer to descendants at all. The CSS selection equivalent just uses a space.</p>

<p><img src="/traversal-find.png" alt="Traversal find" /></p>

<h3 id="next">next()</h3>

<p><code>next()</code> get the immediate next sibling of each DOM element. It&rsquo;s quite helpful to make assertions on several elements by just going through them one by one. CSS selection uses <code>+</code> to accomplish this. There are quite a lot of variations on this command (<code>nextAll()</code>, <code>nextUntil()</code>, &hellip;).</p>

<p><img src="/traversal-next.png" alt="Traversal next" /></p>

<p>As you can see for each extra call to next you have to add an element to the CSS selector. Conceptually a call to <code>next()</code> is more obvious here.</p>

<h3 id="parent">parent()</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s <a href="(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22811495/is-parent-selector-available-in-css4)">not possible</a> using only CSS4 selectors to get the parent of an element. The only possibility is using the Cypress <code>parent()</code> command.</p>

<p><img src="/traversal-parent.png" alt="Traversal parent" /></p>

<h3 id="siblings">siblings()</h3>

<p>The last command to be discussed here is <code>siblings()</code>. Its CSS selector is <code>~</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/traversal-siblings.png" alt="Traversal siblings" /></p>

<p>Quite useful in a lot of cases and a straightforward command.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Selecting elements in Cypress is not too hard. You can get by on just using <code>cy.get()</code> and some basic knowledge of CSS selectors. However, it doesn&rsquo;t hurt to know the jQuery and DevTools APIs somewhat to make your life easier.</p>

<p>If learning the traversal commands is worth the effort could be up for debate:</p>

<ul>
<li>in most cases using CSS selectors instead of traversal commands is easier

<ul>
<li>you only have to remember a single API (the CSS selectors one)</li>
<li>most CSS combinators are shorter than their Cypress equivalent</li>
</ul></li>
<li>some selections like getting the parent are close to impossible with css selectors so you need a Cypress traversal command.</li>
</ul>

<p>But then again, if it&rsquo;s impossible with css selectors, maybe <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22811495/is-parent-selector-available-in-css4">you shouldn&rsquo;t do it</a>:</p>

<p><em>Supporting it is giving people a whole lot of rope to hang themselves with.</em></p>
