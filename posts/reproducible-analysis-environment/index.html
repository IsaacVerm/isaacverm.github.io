<p>Debug your app, not your environment.</p>

<p>Docker&rsquo;s slogan is a <a href="https://www.docker.com/">good one</a>. It&rsquo;s a pity when you can&rsquo;t focus on the work at hand because of environment issues. You end up trying to fix both your code and the environment at the same which frankly is just a world of pain. Docker helps with creating a reproducible environment so you can count on the environment being always in the state you want.</p>

<p>Small remark, the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/">official Docker documentation</a> is really good, you don&rsquo;t really need a lot of extra info. However, this <a href="https://colinfay.me/docker-r-reproducibility/">simple example</a> really helper me on my way.</p>

<p><img src="/do-not-avoid-official-doc.png" alt="do not avoid official doc" /></p>

<h2 id="dockerfile">Dockerfile</h2>

<p>The Dockerfile is actually the only file you need to run anything in Docker. From the official documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Docker builds images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile &ndash; a text file that contains all commands, in order, needed to build a given image.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So a Dockerfile is like a recipe instructing Docker how to build your <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/docker-overview/#docker-objects">image</a>. An image is a template of what your environment will look like. Don&rsquo;t confuse images with containers. Containers are instances of images. You can have many containers based on a single image.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A Dockerfile must begin with a <code>FROM</code> instruction. The FROM instruction specifies the Parent Image from which you are building.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You rarely start from scratch because most of the times you&rsquo;re only interested in keeping constant some aspects of your environment. However, uff you really really want to start from the ground up <a href="https://docs.docker.com/glossary/">you still can</a> by putting <code>FROM scratch</code> at the top of your Dockerfile. <a href="https://ropenscilabs.github.io/r-docker-tutorial/04-Dockerhub.html">Docker Hub is the default images source</a> for <code>FROM</code>. In the beginning it was not clear for me where <code>FROM</code> got its base images from but I found the <code>FROM</code> section in the Dockerfile reference surprisingly paltry.</p>

<p>The image I based myself on is the one by <a href="https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker">rocker</a>. All rocker images are hosted on <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">dockerhub</a>. There are basically 2 types of Docker images provided by rocker:</p>

<ul>
<li>unversioned</li>
<li>versioned</li>
</ul>

<p>Unversioned means the latest R version is used. To keep it as reproducible as possible I&rsquo;d like to use the exact R version as used locally for this series. You can easily find your R version on the command line:</p>

<pre><code>R --version | grep &quot;R version&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>I am running R version 3.6.1 locally (nicknamed &ldquo;Action of the Toes&rdquo;, apparently a reference to <a href="https://twitter.com/snoopy/status/269963551135891456">this</a>). To be sure I&rsquo;m using the Docker image and not the local version of R I install the Docker image with version 3.6.2. This is <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">the latest version available</a> and was released end of 2019. There are different flavors available within each R version including a version with <code>tidyverse</code> and <code>devtools</code> which is exactly what I needed. <code>tidyverse</code> and <code>devtools</code> together cover a large part of the packages used in the reproseries analysis.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/tidyverse">important to note</a> additional packages can only be installed with the R <code>install.packages</code> function and not <code>apt</code>, the Debian packaging tool. R is installed separately from the R version already bundled with Debian so if you would use <code>apt</code> you risk ending up with 2 different versions of R.</p>

<p>Long story short, we can add the following at the top of our Dockerfile:</p>

<pre><code>FROM rocker/tidyverse:3.6.2
</code></pre>

<h2 id="docker-build">docker build</h2>

<p>We can already try our image out, even though at the moment it&rsquo;s just a copy of the rocker image. Running <code>docker build -t repro .</code> shows the rocker image is fetched correctly. The build command only takes 1 mandatory argument which is the <code>PATH</code> for the build context. The <code>.</code> defines where the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#extended-description">build context</a> can be found. We pass a name for the image as well (using <code>-t</code>), if not you always have to refer to the image id (which is hard to remember).</p>

<p>If you want to make sure the image has been created correctly afterwards you can run:</p>

<pre><code>docker images | grep repro
</code></pre>

<p>The build process could be sped up a bit by using a <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#dockerignore-file">.dockerignore</a> file. If you build the <code>Dockerfile</code> without using the <code>.dockerignore</code> file the first line displayed is:</p>

<pre><code>Sending build context to Docker daemon  256.3MB
</code></pre>

<p>This means about 250MB is transferred. Some files transferred are not used. I didn&rsquo;t spend extra time on optimization so I just kept the <code>.dockerignore</code> file empty.</p>

<h2 id="installing-additional-packages">Installing additional packages</h2>

<p>Now we have an image with R and the <code>tidyverse</code> packages installed. However, in our analysis we did more. We used other R packages as well as you can see in the <a href="https://github.com/IsaacVerm/reproseries/blob/master/DESCRIPTION">R package description</a>. We also created scripts to run our analysis for the <a href="https://isaacverm.github.io/posts/reproducible-analysis-orchestration">orchestration</a> post in this series. Let&rsquo;s try to run a script which uses a package we haven&rsquo;t installed yet (<code>timetk</code> for example) and see what error it gives.</p>

<p>We first have to install our own package <code>reproseries</code>. This can be done in 2 separate ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>by copying a tarball</li>
<li>by using <code>devtools::install</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>devtools</code> way is by far the easiest.</p>

<h3 id="tarball">tarball</h3>

<p>Create a tarball of the package by running <code>R CMD build reproseries</code>. Note you have to run this command from the <a href="https://kbroman.org/pkg_primer/pages/build.html">directory that contains reproseries</a> (so a level up the root directoy).</p>

<h3 id="devtools-install">devtools::install</h3>

<p>First we copy our local reproseries repository to the Docker image by adding this to the Dockerfile:</p>

<pre><code>COPY . /reproseries
</code></pre>

<p>Next the following line can be added to the Dockerfile:</p>

<pre><code>RUN R -e &quot;devtools::install('reproseries')&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>This way <code>devtools</code> takes care of the installation. The <code>-e</code> option just tells R to execute the expression within quotes as if a R environment would be open.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s important to pay attention to the difference between <code>RUN</code> and <code>CMD</code>. <code>RUN</code> runs only once while building the image, <code>CMD</code> runs each time you run a container.</p>

<h2 id="run-analysis">Run analysis</h2>

<p>For running the analysis I could have leveraged the work done in the <a href="https://isaacverm.github.io/posts/reproducible-analysis-orchestration/">orchestration</a> post. Orchestration means <code>airflow</code> which also means Python. Setting up the Python environment turned out to be slightly more involved than planned. It&rsquo;s worth a post on its own. As a workaround I created a file <code>analysis.sh</code> which mirrors what the temperatures.py DAG did. First it tidies and transforms the data and based on the transformed data the visualization and modelling part is ran.</p>

<h2 id="getting-the-results-back-locally">Getting the results back locally</h2>

<p>Now everything is ready to run the analysis:</p>

<ul>
<li>R is installed</li>
<li>our repository has been copied to the Docker image</li>
<li>additional packages needed have been installed</li>
<li>the analysis script has been added as the default run command</li>
</ul>

<p>If we run the container now, the analysis runs just fine. Which is great but where are the results? They&rsquo;re still in the container but not on your local machine. To get the Docker container to share its data with your local machine, you can create a <a href="https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/">volume</a> when running the container.</p>

<h2 id="push-container-to-docker-hub">Push container to Docker Hub</h2>

<p>As the cherry on the cake, I want everything to be able to reproduce my analysis as easily as possible. That&rsquo;s why the image is available in the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/isaacverminck/reproseries">reproseries repository</a> on Docker Hub.</p>

<p><a href="https://ropenscilabs.github.io/r-docker-tutorial/04-Dockerhub.html">Pushing an image to Docker</a> is easy:</p>

<ul>
<li>login to Docker Hub</li>
<li>tag the image</li>
<li>push it to Docker Hub</li>
</ul>

<p>To test the image out for yourself:</p>

<pre><code>docker run -e PASSWORD=&quot;&quot; -v LOCAL_DATA_FOLDER:/data isaacverminck/reproseries:repro
</code></pre>

<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to specify a password (you&rsquo;re prompted to do so) and to specify the folder on your local machine where you&rsquo;d like the data to be stored.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Using Docker isn&rsquo;t as complex as it sounds. You just need to know what a Dockerfile is, what the basic commands are you can use in a Dockerfile and the difference between an image and a container.</p>

<p>As usual the code can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/IsaacVerm/reproseries">reproseries</a> repository on GitHub.</p>
