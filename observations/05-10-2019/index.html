<p>The scene is from the story reported by Herodotus, concerning the corrupt Person judge Sisamnes. He was flayed alive on the order of King Cambyses as a punishment for violating the rules of justice. The scene of the painting is Sisamnes’ son dispensing justice from his father’s chair upholstered with the flayed skin as a reminderr that justice comes, literally, skin in the game (<em>Skin in the game, p.40</em>).</p>
