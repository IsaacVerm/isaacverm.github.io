			<p>Another chess analysis but this time I annotated a bit different than I did for the one of <a href="https://isaacverm.github.io/observations/24-09-2019/">24-09-2019</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>less focus on strategy</li>
<li>only using local analysis</li>
<li>tags</li>
</ul>

<p>Blunders made are still quite big. These have to be purged first before making sound strategic decisions pay off.</p>

<p>By default Lichess annotates your game with automated comments like blunder, mistake,&hellip; I found those quite annoying but since there&rsquo;s no option to turn them off somehow forcing you to manually remove them one by one, for the time being I choose to only use local analysis. It&rsquo;s less powerful than the server-side analysis but since I still play quite badly at the moment that&rsquo;s no issue :).</p>

<p>Also I started using tags. At the moment the following have been defined:</p>

<ul>
<li>[strategy]</li>
<li>[question]</li>
<li>[blunder]</li>
</ul>

<p>Tags will make it easier to see exactly where my play goes wrong once I&rsquo;ve got more games analyzed. E.g. searching for the [blunder] tag to get an overview of the type of blunders I make most then is trivial.</p>

<p>+++++</p>

<p>Generalities out of the way, I annotated this game:</p>

<iframe width=600 height=371 src="https://lichess.org/study/embed/oTkdoGxG/3GfBdAEJ" frameborder=0></iframe>

<p>Correctly spotted a bishop fork in the beginning netting me a piece. However, made 2 massive blunders shortly after one another making me lose the game. <em>16 &hellip; Ne5</em>: made my own queen overworked. My opponent didn&rsquo;t notice but directly after <em>17 &hellip; Be6</em> leaving the knight on e5 almost hanging (after the combination) signed my death warrant.</p>

<p>A move also marked as blunder by Stockfish was <em>13 &hellip; Bg4</em>.  No idea why because when going through the optimal variation I seem to end up in quite a bad situation (exposed king, double pawn).</p>

<p>About as dry as you expect a German industrial musician to be.</p>
