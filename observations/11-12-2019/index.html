<blockquote>
<p>The ensemble &ldquo;Amabano&rdquo; was created in 1978 the basis of the orchestra. the play musicians from Burundi, Kenya and Zaire who have decided during a speech on radio station &ldquo;the Voice of Burundi revolution&rdquo; to join a group called &ldquo;the Explorers&rdquo;, soon renamed &ldquo;Amabano&rdquo;.
Goal of ensemble members consider promoting Burundian music modern means. It is very good at it.
In 1979 they took first place at the contest &ldquo;Golden windmill&rdquo; organized by the program of radio Netherlands, which was attended by over 400 African groups. This album introduces for the first time the Soviet listeners with rock music of Africa.</p>
