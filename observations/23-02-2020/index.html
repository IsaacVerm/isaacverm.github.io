<p>I cannot force you to believe in God. Believing in God amounts to coming to terms with death. When you have accepted death, the problem of God will be solved — <a href="https://havecoffeewillwrite.com/?p=56001">and not the reverse</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Back in 2016, I lived in a small studio apartment in Manhattan. It was a Monday night, and I was staring at my computer trying to write a short story. I hadn&rsquo;t written fiction since high school, but I had recently signed up for a writing class. My first assignment was due at 9am the next day. Desperate for any distraction, I became fixated on my keyboard. It was so dusty and grimy. How had I not noticed this before? I used the same keyboard for six years, typed on it 20-30 hours per week, and ate all my meals in front of it.</p>
