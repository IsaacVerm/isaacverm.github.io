<p>We stopped talking about football. That was a problem, because football was our life.</p>

<p>On the pitch, strange things started to happen for me. I was playing as a striker, and I began scoring these incredible goals. Left foot, right foot, headers; from 10 meters, from 50 meters. It was crazy. And I didn’t even realise it, but people were filming my goals and putting them on YouTube. I guess some of them went viral on social media, and soon everyone in Belgium was talking about this guy in the Third Division scoring these crazy goals.</p>

<p>They probably didn’t realise he worked at a car factory.</p>

<p>It’s funny to explain, but do you know why I scored those goals? Because I really felt like I was free. I was no longer playing out of obligation. I had escaped the “talent factory” at Standard Liège. There was no longer anyone on the sidelines telling me, “You have to do this, otherwise you won’t succeed.”</p>

<p>When we think of computers, we think of the twenty-first century. But did you know that <a href="https://humansofdata.atlan.com/2019/08/historical-humans-of-data-mahalanobis/">India started using them back in the 1950s</a>?</p>

<p>If the universe is so bad, or even
half so bad, how on earth did human beings ever come to attribute it to the activity of a wise and good Creator? Men are fools,
perhaps; but hardly so foolish as that. The direct inference from
black to white, from evil flower to virtuous root, from senseless
work to a workman infinitely wise, staggers belief.</p>
