<p><em>The acts of the mind, wherein it exerts its power over simple ideas, are chiefly these three: 1. Combining several simple ideas into one compound one, and thus all complex ideas are made. 2. <strong>The second is bringing two ideas, whether simple or complex, together, and setting them by one another so as to take a view of them at once, without uniting them into one</strong>, by which it gets all its ideas of relations. 3. The third is separating them from all other ideas that accompany them in their real existence: this is called abstraction, and thus all its general ideas are made.</em></p>

<p>U2 and John Locke are one, but they&rsquo;re not the same. By accident listening to this while reading the <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-9.html">introductory programming chapter</a> starting with the quote.</p>

<p>+++++</p>

<p>Everybody was listening&ndash;men, women and children.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t even know.</p>

<p>On Thursday at 4 p.m I have a business meeting at the office.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not true.</p>

<p>Like it or not.</p>

<p>He loves her, and she loves him.</p>

<p>Tell him to come in.</p>

<p>I have a cat. It likes to play with me.</p>

<p>He is my best friend.</p>

<p>He is a good host, his house is always full of friends.</p>

<p>+++++</p>

<p>Слушали все: и мужчины, и женщины, и дети.</p>

<p>Я даже и не знаю.</p>

<p>В четве́рг в четы́ре ча́са дня у меня́ делова́я встре́ча в о́фисе.</p>

<p>Это не правда.</p>

<p>Хочешь не хочешь.</p>

<p>Он лю́бит её, а она́ лю́бит его́.</p>

<p>Скажи́те ему́, что́бы он вошёл. (вошёл &lt; войти́)</p>

<p>У меня́ есть кот. Он лю́бит игра́ть со мной. (instrumental)</p>

<p>Он мой лу́чший друг.</p>

<p>Он хоро́ший хозя́ин, в его́ до́ме всегда́ мно́го друзе́й.</p>
