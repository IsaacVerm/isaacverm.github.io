<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_the_Younger_of_Brunswick">Christian</a> the absolute mad lad.</p>

<p>From the book by C.V. Wedgwood I&rsquo;m reading on the Thirty Years&rsquo; War.</p>

<p>How to make sure you get your money if you pass a village:</p>

<p><em>He had issued startling letters, suggestively burnt at the four corners, and bearing the words &lsquo;Fire! Fire! Blood! Blood!&rsquo; to every sizeable village he passed.</em></p>

<p>Or how to handle a right arm amputation graciously:</p>

<p><em>He had been wounded in the right arm and had to have it amputated a few days later, an occasion which he used for a spectacular displayd of physical courage. The operation was performed to a fanfare of trumpets.</em></p>

<p>Even better description <a href="http://oandpnews.org/2010/09/15/prostheticschronicles-13/">here</a>:</p>

<p><em>Christian insisted on the ceremonial amputation “to inspirit his
troops, and show them that he accounted it an honor thus to suffer in the cause
of a lady, to whose service he had devoted his life.”</em></p>
