<p>For decades, places such as Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, Gibraltar and others sold the companies that people hide behind when committing their crimes. But in recent years, the world has changed – those jurisdictions have been cajoled, bullied and persuaded to keep good records of company ownership, and to reveal those records when police officers come looking. They are no longer as useful as they used to be. So where is? This is where the UK comes in. When it comes to financial crime, Britain is your best friend.</p>

<p>The 45 minute piece called <a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/blog/los-guaqueros-100-years-of-sampling/">“La Tragedia Rustica”</a> combines samples of various early recordings from Bogotá, alongside ethnomusicological field recordings, all woven together in real time in Ableton Live and accompanied by an animated sequence, manipulated live by Rivano (himself a celebrated street artist in Colombia).</p>
