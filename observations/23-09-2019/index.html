A disappearance begins internally, experienced en masse, but with each one—roses, photographs, and fruit follow—long-coated, stone-faced Memory Police sweep through the village, ensuring that all traces of the disappeared concept or object is gone for good.

<p><em>A disappearance begins internally, experienced en masse, but with each one—roses, photographs, and fruit follow—long-coated, stone-faced Memory Police sweep through the village, ensuring that all traces of the disappeared concept or object is gone for good. What exactly causes disappearances is never addressed; instead, the mystery lies in how far they&rsquo;ll go, and what role the Memory Police play. Because disappearance isn&rsquo;t confined to concepts: The Memory Police also root out and cart away any villagers who don&rsquo;t forget.</em></p>

<p><em>Our memories are disappearing, though there&rsquo;s no Memory Police making sure they stay gone. Instead, there&rsquo;s the ceaseless churn of internet eddying past us, tugging our focus into the undertow.</em></p>
