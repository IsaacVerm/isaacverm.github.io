<blockquote>
<p>You realise a lot of things; you dissect a lot of things when you spend an extended period by yourself. Self-pity can be quite delicious when you’re by yourself. You can allow yourself that self-pity because you’re not really burdening anybody else with it.</p>

<p>He’s 51 now and never thinks of retiring because, he said, “<a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-05-11-ca-1497-story.html">I’m kind of retired now</a>. You have to remember I didn’t do anything for the last five years.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s a quiet life and it had its advantages. There’s no responsibility: You don’t have anything to clean up, it’s cheap, the bills are a cash deal. I’d bicycle most places, which I found could be faster than a car. I didn’t own a phone. As far as business goes it was kind of slim because if you don’t communicate you don’t do too much business nowadays.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No one really knows what run-of-the-mill depression is. You&rsquo;ll think somebody has run-of-the-mill depression, and then the next thing you know, they&rsquo;re hanging from a rope. It&rsquo;s hard to tell the difference. But I do feel that depression can be useful. Sometimes it&rsquo;s just chemical. It doesn&rsquo;t seem to come from anywhere. And whenever I&rsquo;ve been in any kind of depression, I&rsquo;ve over the years tried to not only imagine what it feels like to not be there, but try to remind myself that I could just wake up the next day and it could be gone because that happens, and not to worry about it. And at the same time, when I&rsquo;m feeling great, I remember the depression and think about the differences in what I&rsquo;m feeling and why I would feel that way, and not be reactionary one way or the other. You just have to realize that these are patterns of life and you just go through them.</p>
