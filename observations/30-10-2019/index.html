<p>Sounds a bit too much like an American inspiring life quote but still true. <a href="http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/vignettes.html">If you’re thinking without writing, you only think you’re thinking</a>.</p>

<p>Such a brilliant blog, too bad it stopped after 10 or so posts&hellip;</p>

<p><a href="http://klutometis.org/bobcat-holocaust.html">bobcat holocaust</a>.</p>

<p><em>I discovered this when there appeared the apparition of a levitating chicken on the lawn which, upon closer inspection, was suspended in the maw of its ailuroid plunderer.</em></p>

<hr />

<p><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/pi-synthesisers/">Cars</a> was recorded using only four synth tracks and a real live drummer.</p>

<p>The discipline of only having a limited amount of polyphony and a limited number of tracks brought about music that was, when at its best, so tightly and elegantly arranged that it keeps all of its impact today.</p>

<p>Words are very unnecessary<br />
They can only do harm</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-50137450">Businessman Tan Youhui</a>
hired a hitman to take out his competitor for 282,000 dollars, a court heard.</p>

<p>But the hitman hired another man to do the job, offering 141,000 dollars. That man hired another hitman, who hired another hitman, who hired another hitman.</p>

<p>The plan crumbled when the final hitman met the man, named only as Wei, in a cafe and proposed faking his death.</p>

<hr />

<p>It was a good day for <a href="http://klutometis.org/old-bookstore.html">observations</a>.</p>

<hr />

<p>It&rsquo;s a good idea to limit yourself to a fixed number of characters per post like <a href="https://sjackman.ca/2016-02-15-r-and-make/">this guy</a> seems to do.</p>

<p>Like my father used to say:</p>

<p><em>In der Beschränkung zeigt sich erst der Meister.</em></p>

<p>Apparently originally from <a href="https://gutenberg.spiegel.de/buch/sonette-3649/1">Goethe</a>, never knew.</p>

<p>As the project grew in scope the code I would write acquired features like a boat hull acquires <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/how-should-i-organize-my-r-research-projects/">barnacles</a>.</p>
