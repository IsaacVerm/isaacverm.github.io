<p>I had an old, loud China gander that was displaced by a younger gander—his son, as a matter of fact, who ended up with the old goose we named Jocasta. From the time of Adam, we humans have had an urge to name the birds of the sky and the beasts of the field. The old gander may have been defeated by the son, but he remained feisty. Then he became ill, got weak, ate very little, couldn&rsquo;t walk, sat only in shade and moaned. He was immobilized. I dissolved in water some erythromycin I got at the feed store and squirted it down his throat with a turkey baster, and added some more to his water.</p>

<p>Several weeks went by. He lost weight, but I could see that he was sipping from his dish. From time to time I carried him to the pond—he paddled and dipped his head and beak, but he was too weak to crawl out. Still he seemed to respond to this physiotherapy. After a month he began to eat. One morning, going out to give him more medicine, I saw that he was standing and able to walk. I brought him some food, and as I put the food in his dish he took a few steps toward me and bit me hard on the thigh, giving me a purple prune-size bruise. This is not an example of irony or ingratitude. It is goosishness. He was thankfully himself again.</p>

<p>Later that year, during their appearance on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, he bribed a stagehand to load gunpowder into one of his bass drums; the stagehand used about ten times the standard amount. During the finale of &ldquo;My Generation&rdquo;, he kicked the drum off the riser and set off the charge. The intensity of the explosion singed Townshend&rsquo;s hair and embedded a piece of cymbal in Moon&rsquo;s arm.</p>

<p>Carlsen suggest <a href="https://www.habitsofchesssuccess.com/magnus-carlsen-on-chess-improvement/">not sitting during the whole game</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whenever it’s your opponent’s move, as long as you don’t leave the playing hall, you can basically do whatever you want. You can walk away. In general I don’t think you can keep full concentration for very long. I couldn’t bear to sit there for seven hours.</p>

<p>Putting congratulations aside, Nate quickly reminds himself that he has committed multiple homicides to save Warren before letting his friend know that there are females nearby if he wishes to fornicate with them. Warren recalls that it was the promise of copulation that coaxed him away from his previous activities, and is thankful that Nate knows a way to satisfy these urges. Nate quickly finds the women who earlier crashed their car on Nate&rsquo;s account. He remarks to one that he is fond of her physical appeal. The woman, impressed by Nate&rsquo;s singing ability, asks that he and Warren allow her and her friends to share transportation.</p>

<p>Took this picture because it all looked paradisiac.</p>

<p>So you think you can tell heaven from hell?</p>

<p>But even in heaven they build bunkers. Noticed this immediately after taking the previous picture.</p>

<p><img src="/bunker-tussen-groene-wandeling-en-siphon.jpg" alt="bunker tussen groene wandeling en siphon" /></p>

<p>And such strange ones. The bottom part was bricks instead of concrete. Wonder how that came about?</p>

<p>Als je erover nadenkt zou je in Blokken beter nooit een lijn maken. Je weet niet of het volgende correcte antwoord zal gegeven worden door jou of je tegenstander. Om zo dicht mogelijk bij elkaar te blijven in score is het dus beter om nooit iets te bouwen.</p>

<p>Best trots op dit spel. Geen blunders, lekker strak.</p>
