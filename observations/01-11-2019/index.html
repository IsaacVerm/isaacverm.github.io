<p><em>I&rsquo;ll be more enthusiastic about encouraging <a href="https://www.lspace.org/books/pqf/alt-fan-pratchett.html">thinking outside the box</a> when there&rsquo;s evidence of any thinking going on inside it.</em></p>

<hr />

<p>I was in <a href="http://cristal.inria.fr/~weis/info/commandline.html">Disney World</a> recently, specifically the part of it called the Magic Kingdom, walking up Main Street USA. This is a perfect gingerbready Victorian small town that culminates in a Disney castle. It was very crowded; we shuffled rather than walked. Directly in front of me was a man with a camcorder. It was one of the new breed of camcorders where instead of peering through a viewfinder you gaze at a flat-panel color screen about the size of a playing card, which televises live coverage of whatever the camcorder is seeing. He was holding the appliance close to his face, so that it obstructed his view. Rather than go see a real small town for free, he had paid money to see a pretend one, and rather than see it with the naked eye he was watching it on television.</p>

<p>And rather than stay home and read a book, I was watching him.</p>
