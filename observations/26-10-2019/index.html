<p>Just under a century ago, the Soviet Union <a href="[https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/11/why-dont-i-see-you-anymore/598336/]">embarked on one of the strangest attempts to reshape the common calendar</a> that has ever been undertaken. As Joseph Stalin raced to turn an agricultural backwater into an industrialized nation, his government downsized the week from seven to five days. Saturday and Sunday were abolished.</p>

<p>In place of the weekend, a new system of respite was introduced in 1929. The government divided workers into five groups, and assigned each to a different day off. On any given day, four-fifths of the proletariat would show up to their factories and work while the other fifth rested. Each laborer received a colored slip of paper—yellow, orange, red, purple, or green—that signified his or her group. The staggered schedule was known as nepreryvka, or the “continuous workweek,” since production never stopped.</p>
