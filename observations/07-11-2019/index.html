When they became civilized, the concept of <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/books/is-modern-life-making-us-miserable-civilized-to-death-author-christopher-ryan-thinks-so/">progress</a> led to misery.</p>

<p>To emphasize the work ethic in Protestantism relative to Catholics, he notes a common problem that industrialists face when employing precapitalist laborers: Agricultural entrepreneurs will try to encourage time spent harvesting by offering a higher wage, with the expectation that laborers will see time spent working as more valuable and so engage it longer. However, in precapitalist societies this often results in laborers spending less time harvesting. Laborers judge that they can earn the same, while spending less time working and having more leisure. He also notes that societies having more Protestants are those that have a more developed capitalist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protestant_Ethic_and_the_Spirit_of_Capitalism#Basic_concepts">economy</a>.</p>
