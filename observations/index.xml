 No, we&amp;rsquo;re not full of fears and anxieties about our position in the food chain, and never have been, because a species is not a person who can remember things like having been the underdog of the savannah tens of millennia in the past.

Zuckerbot, should we trust you?
 I recently uncovered a physical plaque that could potentially be about a billion years old and it already generates about one million hours of video content passively overnight. So you can trust that.

      <description>First entry I ever noticed on RPubs. Holy duality of pie chart and calling every document final. Hope the author is ok.
“I could come up with something else of my own again, put it out on a label, tour, etc. It’s just gotta feel free if that happens. I will probably honestly be 40 or 50 when that happens and extremely fat.”
I work on R packages that alleviate some of the pain of transforming and presenting data in a dreary office environment.</description>

      <description>Murderball was invented by the Quadfather.
The author’s explanation is that humans were essentially happy and satisfied with their lives. When they became civilized, the concept of progress led to misery.
    They came to do good, they did very well indeed.
To emphasize the work ethic in Protestantism relative to Catholics, he notes a common problem that industrialists face when employing precapitalist laborers: Agricultural entrepreneurs will try to encourage time spent harvesting by offering a higher wage, with the expectation that laborers will see time spent working as more valuable and so engage it longer.</description>

      <description>Old Believers, you have to update!
After the implementation of these revisions, the Church anathematized and suppressed—with the support of Muscovite state power—the prior liturgical rite itself, as well as those who were reluctant to pass to the revised rite.
That’s forcing people to upgrade, no depreciation warning.
Things have changed.

John Donne.
He spent much of the money he inherited during and after his education on womanising, literature, pastimes, and travel. In 1601, Donne secretly married Anne More, with whom he had twelve children. In 1615 he was ordained deacon and then Anglican priest, although he did not want to take Holy Orders and only did so because the king ordered it.</description>

      <description>‘Automating’ comes from the roots ‘auto-‘ meaning ‘self-‘, and ‘mating’, meaning ‘screwing’.
Test automation must be the absolute superlative then.
Skin in the game: if because of a bug in devtools a member of R-core gets angry with you, I will send you a handwritten apology note. Just forward me the email and your address, and I&amp;rsquo;ll get a card in the mail.

      <description>Lover&amp;rsquo;s grave
I can read.
It is magnificent, isn&amp;rsquo;t it? You see, the thing about shock &amp;hellip; is not that it upsets some people, I think; I think that it gives others a momentary joy of liberation, as we realized in that instant that the social rules that constrict our lives so terribly are not actually very important.

      <description>Some interesting eavesdropping.
The moment those drums kick in&amp;hellip;
Just under a century ago, the Soviet Union embarked on one of the strangest attempts to reshape the common calendar that has ever been undertaken. As Joseph Stalin raced to turn an agricultural backwater into an industrialized nation, his government downsized the week from seven to five days. Saturday and Sunday were abolished.
In place of the weekend, a new system of respite was introduced in 1929.</description>

      <description>All of the sudden I felt like someone punched me in the stomach with a baseball bat. I got the wind knocked out of me and stumbled backwards. When I looked up there was a 40 oz. bottle at my feet. It had hit me in the gut/dick.
The perpetrator was a 300 lb. black sister who was standing right below me at my monitor. I looked her right in the eye and she waved me forward, as if she was going to tell me a secret.</description>

      <description>This decision was made to increase the amount of funding received from the European Union, which dedicates a third of its budget (50 billion euros) to less economically developed regions for investments in infrastructure, such as schools and hospitals. Yet when regions improve economically, they no longer qualify for the same amount of funding. As a type of statistical gerrymandering, governors of these regions—like in Hungary—have redrawn their borders in order to keep the money flowing.</description>

  Andy Warhol New York Diet.
“When I order in a restaurant, I order everything that I don’t want, so I have a lot to play around with while everyone else eats,” he wrote in The Philosophy of Andy Warhol. “Then, no matter how chic the restaurant is, I insist that the waiter wrap the entire plate up like a to-go order, and after we leave the restaurant I find a little corner outside in the street to leave the plate in, because there are so many people in New York who live in the streets.</description>

      <description>Penitentials were handbooks carried by some priests in the Middle Ages that delineated various sins for private confession and their penances. They were full of strict limitations as to what constituted pious behavior. They went on and on. To digest it all, James A Brundage, a scholar of the Crusades, aggregated the complex rules about sex into this excellent flowchart.

      <description>The UK is the biggest tax haven.
For decades, places such as Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, Gibraltar and others sold the companies that people hide behind when committing their crimes. But in recent years, the world has changed – those jurisdictions have been cajoled, bullied and persuaded to keep good records of company ownership, and to reveal those records when police officers come looking. They are no longer as useful as they used to be.</description>

      <description>Carrier bag theory.
Not only is the carrier bag theory plausible, it also does meaningful ideological work — shifting the way we look at humanity&amp;rsquo;s foundations from a narrative of domination to one of gathering, holding, and sharing. Because I am, despite my best efforts, often soppy and sentimental, I sometimes imagine this like a really comforting group hug. But it’s not, really: the carrier bag holds things, sure, but it’s also messy and sometimes conflicted</description>

      <description>Another chess analysis but this time I annotated a bit different than I did for the one of 24-09-2019:
 less focus on strategy only using local analysis tags  Blunders made are still quite big. These have to be purged first before making sound strategic decisions pay off.
By default Lichess annotates your game with automated comments like blunder, mistake,&amp;hellip; I found those quite annoying but since there&amp;rsquo;s no option to turn them off somehow forcing you to manually remove them one by one, for the time being I choose to only use local analysis.</description>

      <description>Yeah.
Being in New York compounded a feeling I had been experiencing, of profound dissociation from my own life. I knew, as I wandered through museums with friends and video-chatted with Ian, that I needed to leave the tech industry. I was no longer high on the energy of being around people who so easily satisfied their desires––on the feeling that everything was just within reach. The industry’s hubris and naïveté were beginning to grate; I had moral, political, and personal misgivings about Silicon Valley’s accelerating colonization of art, work, everyday life.</description>

Could be.
A disappearance begins internally, experienced en masse, but with each one—roses, photographs, and fruit follow—long-coated, stone-faced Memory Police sweep through the village, ensuring that all traces of the disappeared concept or object is gone for good. What exactly causes disappearances is never addressed; instead, the mystery lies in how far they&amp;rsquo;ll go, and what role the Memory Police play.</description>

      <description>Борис самый большой молодец всех времен.
+++++
Boris is the biggest little boy of all times.
+++++
самый большой = most big = biggest
молодец &amp;lt; молодой which means young. ец is a suffix appended to adjectives to create a masculine noun denoting a person having the adjective&amp;rsquo;s quality. So in this case a man who is young is a boy. The more conventional word for boy is мальчик which is interesting as well because it&amp;rsquo;s a combination of малый +‎ -чик.</description>
