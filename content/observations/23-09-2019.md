_A disappearance begins internally, experienced en masse, but with each one—roses, photographs, and fruit follow—long-coated, stone-faced Memory Police sweep through the village, ensuring that all traces of the disappeared concept or object is gone for good. What exactly causes disappearances is never addressed; instead, the mystery lies in how far they'll go, and what role the Memory Police play. Because disappearance isn't confined to concepts: The Memory Police also root out and cart away any villagers who don't forget._

_Our memories are disappearing, though there's no Memory Police making sure they stay gone. Instead, there's the ceaseless churn of internet eddying past us, tugging our focus into the undertow._
