[Christian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_the_Younger_of_Brunswick) the absolute mad lad.

From the book by C.V. Wedgwood I'm reading on the Thirty Years' War.

How to make sure you get your money if you pass a village:

_He had issued startling letters, suggestively burnt at the four corners, and bearing the words 'Fire! Fire! Blood! Blood!' to every sizeable village he passed._

Or how to handle a right arm amputation graciously:

_He had been wounded in the right arm and had to have it amputated a few days later, an occasion which he used for a spectacular displayd of physical courage. The operation was performed to a fanfare of trumpets._

Even better description [here](http://oandpnews.org/2010/09/15/prostheticschronicles-13/):

_Christian insisted on the ceremonial amputation “to inspirit his
troops, and show them that he accounted it an honor thus to suffer in the cause
of a lady, to whose service he had devoted his life.”_
