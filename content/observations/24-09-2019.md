Quite a bad game on my part with some horrendous blunders at the end as the cherry on the cake. But at least I made a post game analysis for once.

Some general things to remember are:

- dare choose the more aggressive move if possible (why not go for that sweet queen exchange???)
- do not play when it gets too late (but I know that rule will always be broken)
