Борис самый большой молодец всех времен.

+++++

Boris is the biggest little boy of all times.

+++++

самый большой = most big = biggest

молодец < молодой which means [young](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-%D0%B5%D1%86#Russian). ец is a suffix appended to adjectives to create a masculine noun denoting a person having the adjective's quality. So in this case a man who is young is a boy. The more conventional word for boy is мальчик which is interesting as well because it's a combination of малый +‎ -чик. малый means small and чик makes it even smaller so it's a boy.

всех = genitive plural of весь (all)

времен = genitive plural of время (time)

+++++

All of this to say what can't be explained in words:
